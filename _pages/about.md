Hi! I'm Lingxi (pronounced <u>ling-see</u>). 

I was born and raised in Singapore, before moving to Oxford, UK for my undergraduate studies. I'm now pursuing a PhD with the [Energy and Technology Policy Group](https://epg.ethz.ch/) in Zürich, Swiitzerland.

My current research focuses on __understanding technology__, specifically the phenomenon of [learning-by-doing](https://ourworldindata.org/learning-curve), so that we can make more __effective climate policies__. 

Reach out to me for collab or discussions! I don't respond to Nigerian princes or crypto investment opportunities.
