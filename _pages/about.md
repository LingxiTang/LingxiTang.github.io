Hi! I'm Lingxi (pronounced <u>ling-see</u>). 

I was born and raised in ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬, before moving to Oxford ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ for my undergraduate studies. After living in the UK for ~6 years, I'm now pursuing a PhD with the [Energy and Technology Policy Group](https://epg.ethz.ch/) in ZÃ¼rich ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­.

My current research focuses on __understanding technology__, specifically the phenomenon of [learning-by-doing](https://ourworldindata.org/learning-curve), so that we can make more __effective climate policies__. 

Specifically on advanced nuclear energy & aviation decarbonisation via synthetic fuels and direct air capture.

Climate aside, I'm concerned about AI misalignment, interested in politics and fascinated by how little we know about our brain.

Reach out to me for collab or discussions! I don't respond to Nigerian princes or crypto investment opportunities.
