All scenarios are purely hypothetical. I have 0 background in political science. As such, the scenarios are based on extremely crude assumptions, and so are quite flawed. <em>Gahmen, pls don’t pofma.</em></p> <hr> <p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p> <p>The Members of Parliament (MPs) of Singapore are elected on a five-year cycle based on a first-past-the-post Westminster system, i.e. in each constituency, the MP(s) that get the most votes wins. In all countries that follow this system, each constituency only has one MP, until 1988.</p> <p>In the 1988 Singaporean General Election (GE), the GRC system was introduced. Group Representative Constituencies, or GRCs, are constituencies which have multiple seats. i.e. the party which has the most votes in a GRC wins all the seats in the GRC. A key feature of GRCs was that at least one MP in each GRC must be from a minority community, or simply, non-Chinese.</p> <p>Why introduce GRCs? Officially, it was to guarantee a multiracial parliament. After all, SMCs do run the risk of having a Parliament full of Chinese MPs.</p> <p>Unofficially, many accuse the GRC system of a being a gerrymandering system (See graphic below).</p> <p>That led me to the question: <em>How well did the GRC system gerrymander? How different would the Singapore Parliament have been if GRCs were never implemented?</em></p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/gerrymandering-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/gerrymandering-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/gerrymandering-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/gerrymandering.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Gerrymandering" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Best graphic to explain gerrymandering. The main idea is that you draw constituency boundaries so that you win more votes in each constituency. </div> <hr> <p><strong>RESEARCH DESIGN</strong></p> <p>To answer this question, I looked at the GE results from 1988 to 2010, and applied hypothetical changes based on the following assumptions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Seats in GRCs split proportionally based on votes. E.g. If a 4-member GRC had a vote split of 75:25, the seats would be split 3:1.</p> </li> <li> <p>Results of SMCs remain the same.</p> </li> <li> <p>PAP gets the rounded up number of seats based on the vote proportion. e.g. If PAP wins 51-75% of votes in a 4-member GRC, they win 3 seats. (This is the Pro-PAP scenario. More scenarios later.)</p> </li> </ul> <hr> <p><strong>RESULTS</strong></p> <p>Alright, let’s look at how many seats each party would have gained/lost in this PURELY HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIO, as compared to reality.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/SeatChanges_ProPAP-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/SeatChanges_ProPAP-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/SeatChanges_ProPAP-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/SeatChanges_ProPAP.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Seat Changes (Pro PAP)" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Fig 1: Seat changes for parties if GRCs were not implemented.<br> Oof. Big losses for PAP. </div> <p>As expected, if GRCs had been proportionally represented, we see the winning party (historically PAP) losing their seats. Because the votes that had gone unrepresented are now actually translating to seats won.</p> <p>Interestingly, in 2020, even WP benefitted from the GRC system because they, well, won GRC seats, in Aljunied and Sengkang.</p> <p>I know what you’re thinking. <em>Bruh, where’s the label for 2011</em></p> <p>Turns out it’s a bug caused by the fact that WP didn’t contest any GRCs in 2001. This then led me to realise that WP was not the main opposition party until relatively recently. In fact, between 1988 and 2001, WP only won 1 seat, on par with the Chiam See Tong/Chee Soon Juan parties of SDP, SPP and SDA.</p> <p><em>What happened in 2011? Why the big spike in seat changes?</em></p> <p>To answer this, I thought it might be because GRC seat numbers jumped in 2011 and so, to confirm this, I plotted the % of seats which were in GRCs vs SMCs since 1988 (See Left below).</p> <p>Anddd I was wrong: % of seats in GRCs were pretty stable since 1997. So, this couldn’t have been the reason behind the 2011 spike in seat changes.</p> <p>I looked bit deeper and alas, 2011 was the first year since 1988 that all seats were contested. As in, between 1988 and 2006, PAP won a bunch of uncontested seats (See Right below).</p> <p>Under my scenario assumptions, these seats would not change since there were no opposition votes. Thus, it makes sense that 2011 would see a spike in the seat change.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/GRCvSMCShare-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/GRCvSMCShare-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/GRCvSMCShare-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/GRCvSMCShare.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="GRCvsSMC Share" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/Uncontested-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/Uncontested-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/Uncontested-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/Uncontested.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Uncontested seats" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Fig 2:<br> Left: Parliament seats from GRCs rose quite quickly up till 1997.<br> Right: PAP grabbing ez seats until 2011.

The simple reason is that the PAP had been winning and so, they’re practically the same scenario. The main differences between these 2 scenarios happen when opposition actually won GRC seats (i.e. WP in 2011 - 2020).</p> <p>Comparing ‘Anti-PAP’ and ‘Pro-PAP’:</p> <p>Now this is where it gets interesting. Basically, what happens is that seat changes doubled in ‘Anti-PAP’ compared to ‘Pro-PAP’. For e.g., if the seat change for PAP was -10 in ‘Pro-PAP’, it would be roughly -20 in ‘Anti-PAP’. These two scenarios could be interpreted as the “best case” and “worst case” for the PAP.</p> <p>In the worst case, oof, 30 SEATS LOST from the PAP, had there been no GRC.

So yes, the GRC system has been a good gerrymandering tool, which is inherently unfair.</li> </ul> <p><em>But an efficient one-party system is good for Singapore! If it means a stable government, gerrymandering can stay.</em></p> <ul> <li>Well, as we saw in the ‘Pro-PAP’ and ‘Pro-Winner’ scenarios, PAP would have been the ruling party with a supermajority.</li> <li>So, yes, the PAP might have won extra seats due to the GRC system but they’re kinda unnecessary.</li> <li>Worst case (‘Anti-PAP’), PAP might have lost their supermajority since 2011, but they would still have a majority and be able to pass laws easily.</li> <li>Sure, PAP wouldn’t have been able to amend the constitution so easily. To that, I ask, should our Constitution be amended so easily? But that’s for another time.</li> </ul> <p><em>Ok, what about the intended purpose of the GRC system? Has it ensured minority representation in parliament?</em></p> <ul> <li>Yes indeed, accusing the GRC system to only be a gerrymandering tactic isn’t fair. We need to see if it did what it was designed to do. But how might we assess that? A good start would be to look at minority MPs before and after 1988 and see how that changed.</li> <li>Looking at the 1984 GE results (right before GRCs were implemented), I count about 14 minority MPS out of 79 elected seats (17.72%), including ex-WP leader JB Jeyeratnam.</li> <li>For comparison, there were 17 GRCs in 2020. So, effectively, GRCs guaranteed 17 minority MPs out of 93 elected seats (18.28%) in 2020, that’s barely an improvement from 1984 with no GRCs. To be fair, the 2020 GE saw 25 minority MPs out of 93. But still, the necessity of GRCs to ensure minority representation is questionable.</li> <li>So… it didn’t seem like minorities had a problem of a lack of representation in parliament?</li> </ul> <p>In short, I’d argue that the GRC system is not particularly helping PAP in retaining its seats, nor is it making a big difference in minority representation.</p> <hr> <p><strong>FURTHER RANTS ABOUT GRC</strong></p> <p>While writing this, I’ve thought of a few more issues with the GRC system.</p> <p><em>Complacent politicians</em></p> <ul> <li>In GRCs, MPs can piggyback off political powerhouses. Going back to SMCs ensures competition for each and every seat, leading to more engaged and competent MPs.</li> </ul> <p><em>No. of seats</em></p> <ul> <li>Number of seats in GRC is completely random and arbitrary. Like, if you’re gerrymandering, at least make it less obvious; make the number of seats in each GRC the same.</li> </ul> <p><em>On minority quotas</em></p> <ul> <li>Also, do we really still need a quota to ensure minority representation in parliament? Some of our best politicians today are from the minority communities. Most notably, Tharman, Shanmugan, Pritam Singh. It’s almost abit insulting to the minority community to say that affirmative action are needed to guarantee minority MPs. If anything, i think we can agree that these powerhouse ‘minority’ politicians had been hard-carrying their fellow Chinese GRC mates.</li> <li>I think Singapore has moved past voting on racial grounds. Singaporeans can be trusted to look past race and vote based on merit.</li> <li>The existence of a minority quota requirement in parliament is admitting that power in government is still unfairly concentrated in the Chinese community, and I think that is not true.</li> </ul> <hr> <p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p> <p>For the record, I am not even Pro-opposition. Personally, I highly value our unique “democratic one-party system”. Singapore is super lucky to have proper unrigged elections, while enjoying the efficiency of a one-party state.</p> <p>Even so, I still think that the GRC system needs to go. It’s unnecessarily unfair, and it’s not even helping in promoting minority representation in parliament.</p> <p>Even if we still want a form of minority quota as a safeguard, why not mandate parties to have at least 20% of their candidates to be non-Chinese or something.</p> <p>Removing or reforming the GRC system is a step Singapore can take towards a fairer democracy, without radically changing the status quo.</p> <p>And finally,</p> <p>This is really not priority. Climate change is. My vote to the party with the better Net Zero Strategy for Singapore.</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="sticky-bottom mt-5" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container"> © Copyright 2024 Lingxi Tang. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@5.0.0/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-htrLFfZJ6v5udOG+3kNLINIKh2gvoKqwEhHYfTTMICc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.1.0/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZgMyDAIYDYGxbcpJcfUnYwNevG/xi9OHKaR/8GK+jWc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js?85ddb88934d28b74e78031fd54cf8308"></script> <script src="/assets/js/no_defer.js?2781658a0a2b13ed609542042a859126"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js?b7816bd189846d29eded8745f9c4cf77"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/copy_code.js?12775fdf7f95e901d7119054556e495f" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/jupyter_new_tab.js?d9f17b6adc2311cbabd747f4538bb15f"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">window.MathJax={tex:{tags:"ams"}};</script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.0/es5/tex-mml-chtml.min.js"></script> <script defer src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script> <script type="text/javascript">function progressBarSetup(){"max"in document.createElement("progress")?(initializeProgressElement(),$(document).on("scroll",function(){progressBar.attr({value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}),$(window).on("resize",initializeProgressElement)):(resizeProgressBar(),$(document).on("scroll",resizeProgressBar),$(window).on("resize",resizeProgressBar))}function getCurrentScrollPosition(){return $(window).scrollTop()}function initializeProgressElement(){let e=$("#navbar").outerHeight(!0);$("body").css({"padding-top":e}),$("progress-container").css({"padding-top":e}),progressBar.css({top:e}),progressBar.attr({max:getDistanceToScroll(),value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}function getDistanceToScroll(){return $(document).height()-$(window).height()}function resizeProgressBar(){progressBar.css({width:getWidthPercentage()+"%"})}function getWidthPercentage(){return getCurrentScrollPosition()/getDistanceToScroll()*100}const progressBar=$("#progress");window.onload=function(){setTimeout(progressBarSetup,50)};</script> </body> </html>
