Disclaimer: Clearly, this website is still very much a work in progress. I don't even know how you found this but I'm flattered. You can still find my socials below though.

Hi! I'm Lingxi (pronounced ling-see). Quick intro: I'm born and raised in Singapore, before moving to Oxford, UK for my undergraduate studies and working after. I'm now based in Zürich, Switzerland and pursuing a PhD with the [Energy and Technology Policy Group](https://epg.ethz.ch/).

My current research focuses on understanding technological evolution and innovation, particularly through [learning-by-doing](https://ourworldindata.org/learning-curve), so that we can make smarter green policies. If you're like ???, an ELI5 of a key paper in my field is available [here](https://x.com/lingxitang/status/1783213896708313094). My overarching goal is to contribute to societal sustainability. To that end, I keep myself up to date with clean energy and AI technologies, since I am most concerned about climate change and AI misalignment.

I'm also fascinated by how little we know about our brain, why we sleep and the diversity of languages. 

Reach out to me! On LinkedIn for professional collaborations. On X for casual discussions. On e-mail for anything else. I don't respond to Nigerian princes or crypto investment opportunities.
