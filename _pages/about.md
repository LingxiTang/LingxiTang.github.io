Disclaimer: This website is still very much a work in progress. I don't even know how you found this but I'm flattered. You can still find my socials below though.

Hi! I'm Lingxi (pronounced ling-see). I was born and raised in Singapore, before moving to Oxford, UK for my undergraduate studies. After working in Oxford for a while, I'm now pursuing a PhD with the [Energy and Technology Policy Group](https://epg.ethz.ch/) in Zürich, Switzerland.

My current research focuses on understanding technological evolution and innovation, particularly through [learning-by-doing](https://ourworldindata.org/learning-curve), so that we can make more effective climate policies. If you're confused, an ELI5 of a key paper in my field is available [here](https://x.com/lingxitang/status/1783213896708313094). 

My main motivation is to contribute to societal sustainability. To that end, I keep myself up to date with clean energy and AI technologies, since I am most concerned about climate change and AI misalignment.

I'm also fascinated by how little we know about our brain, why we sleep and the diversity of languages. 

Reach out to me on: LinkedIn for professional collaborations. X for casual discussions. e-mail for anything else. I don't respond to Nigerian princes or crypto investment opportunities.
